# Group4-Programming-Group-Project
Group 4 Task Manager - Programming Principles - RT - MF - OO

  For this assingment we all collectivly agreed to create the to-do-list as our topic for the final assingment.
  In the mandatory features portion of the rubric, we decided to take those 10 different functions and divide them up
  equally based on what we felt we were all good at. Listed below is who worked on what feature and who contributed
  (Since we all peiced togeather some code and had eachother help with bug fixes)
  
  Owen:
    Features 1-3
    - Add new task
    - Delete Existing Task
    - Update existing task
  
  Ryan:
    Features 7-9
      - Search for task
      - UI of the program
      - Read and write functions
        to the disk
     
  
  Matteo:
   Features 4-6
      - Display single task
      - Display range of task
      - Display all tasks
   
  This was the easiest way to distribute the workload and get a basis for the strucure of the functions.
  Aditionally, we all had different roles in terms of the final completion of the assingment:
  
  Owen:
   - Added the comments throughout the program
   - Added the read me file
   - Built the rough outline and structure of the main file
  
  Ryan:
   - Worked on troubleshooting his and everyone elses functions
   - Debugged the code and did limit testing to verify that
     all inputs were taken and worked as supposed to 
   - Helped suggest changes and code optimizations
  
  Matteo:
   - Worked on organizing the group and giving us timelines to have certian parts done by
   - Scheduled check ins and got us to verbally explain and talk through our code
   - Edited most function layout and worked on the overall design of the whole project

Our group worked exceptionally well togeather, every member was extreamly helpful and everyone brought good ideas
and implementations forward to eachother. Everyone seemed to have an equal role and no one person seemed to take over the assignment. 
Matteo and Ryan worked exceptionally hard to make some of the functons work properly when Owen was dealing with an illness during the
project.
